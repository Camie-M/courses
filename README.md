    Course projects and tutorials

## :bookmark: About

The current repository is made to keep projects that I did while doing courses or tutorials. That pretty much means that this is not my code, it is just a copy of projects of other people that I did to practice and learn.

I do not keep track if they still work and if the links are correct.

Nowadays, whilst I still do courses and still watch tutorias, I tend to use what I learn in other contexts, with different challenges, so I can learn even more. 

I could just delete these old projects, but I do enjoy the idea of looking at them from time to time to think about how much my code changed.
